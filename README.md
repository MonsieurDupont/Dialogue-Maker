With this editor utility widget, you can easily create dialogues using rich text without having to type the different tags manually.

## How to use
You need to download this plugin first and add it to your project: [Common CPP Functions](https://github.com/MonsieurDupont/CommonCPPFunctions)

Once you download the project, open it. In the content browser, open **DialogueMaker** and right click then select migrate, then choose the new location to be your project's content folder. (You can delete the **SampleText** folder)

To open the widget, just right click on select "Run editor utility widget"

Then, in the settings tab, set **Style DT** to the rich text style data table you want to use; **Decorator class** to the decorator class you want to use and **Decorator DT** to the data table this class uses.

- To wrap text with tags, just select it and choose one of the styles in the same tab.

*Note*: Sometimes, when you select text to wrap it with a rich text tag, it duplicates the text. This bug is currently unresolved and no fix has been found yet.
 
- You can also export the dialogue to a CSV file that you can open with any spreadsheet editor
